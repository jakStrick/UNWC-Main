<div class="team-member-bio"><p>Executive Director and founding member of UNWC (EST 1996), I volunteered for the first 1.5 years establishing a foundation of trust and building investments in conservation with stakeholders, partners, advisors and funders, and all other watershed inhabitants.</p>

<p>I have lived in the forest by the Nehalem river for 30 years and have connected with it since childhood. I spent much time with my beloved Grandma at her oceanfront cottage just south of the Nehalem bay and crawfishing with family elders along the Nehalem river.</p>

<p>At age 16 I lived on the Malheur Wildlife Refuge as a member of the Youth Conservation Corp where I obtained a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for conservation of natural ecology in working landscapes. As a young adult I studied landscape technology and ecology. I volunteered at the Audubon Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, was a den mother for cub scouts, and conducted salmon spawning surveys, and worked with the Nehalem Valley Izaak Walton League. I am member of the Vernonia Grange and have served for over 20 years supporting Patrons of Husbandry and the local community with Faith, Hope, Charity and Fidelity.</p>

<p>A devoted Mother and Grandmother who plans for the seventh generation. I love world travel, drumming, creating, photography, architecture, astronomy, fitness and exploring humanity.</p></div>
